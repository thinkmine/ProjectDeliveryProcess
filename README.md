# Project Delivery Process

A comprehensive, end-to-end guide to our project delivery process. This repository documents the methodologies, standards, workflows, and best practices that support consistent, repeatable, and high-quality delivery across all phases of a project—from initial discovery and requirements analysis to development, testing, release management, and post-deployment operations. Designed as a living resource, it provides templates, checklists, governance models, and reference architectures to ensure teams can plan, execute, and deliver with clarity and alignment.
